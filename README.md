UNC Module 14 Challenge
I used the internet to help me create the bubble chart.  I also used the internet to help me log the data in the console.  I used the internet for help remembering the .metadata command and the for Each function, especially the key-value tags in the metadata section.  I looked back at notes to help with a lot of this.  I used my notes and the internet to remember how to slice.  I needed the internet for the dropdown and picking a color scale for the bubble chart.
